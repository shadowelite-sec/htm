      <p>
        The <b>Department of Computer Science and Applications</b> was
        established in the year 2010. The department curriculum has to keep
        abreast of the new concepts and applications and keep the students
        updated. The department is well equipped and Project work is a part of
        the curriculum. Department exposure to latest technologies to inculcate
        ideas which bridge the industry gap in IT sector by bounding to social
        ethics by conducting workshops, seminars, techtalks. Department
        encourage student-centric learning by allowing students to share in
        decisions, believing in their capacity to lead, and remembering how it
        feels to learn by student communities.

      <p>
        The basic objective of the Department is to open a channel of admission
        for computing courses for students, who have done the 10+2 and are
        interested in taking computing/IT as a career. Department offers
        foundation graduate Programmes these will act as a feeder course for
        higher studies in the area of Computer Science/Applications. And also
        develop skills in software development so as to enable the graduates to
        take up self-employment in Indian and global software market
